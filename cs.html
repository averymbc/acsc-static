<div id="first">
  <h1>What is Sustainability?</h1>
  <div class="left"><ul>
    <li>Refers to the need to develop the sustainable models necessary for both the human race and planet Earth to <b>survive</b>.</li>
    <li><span>Sustainability is a balancing act.</span> <i>The United Nation’s 1987 Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future</i> noted that sustainable development meets the needs of the present without compromising the well-being of future generations.</li>
    <li>In 2000, the <i>Earth Charter</i> broadened the definition of sustainability to include the idea of <b>a global society “founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace.”</b></li>
  </ul></div>

  <h2>What is the Sustainability Mindset?</h2>
  <div class="right"><ul>
    <li><span>Constant Reevaluation</span> This points to a continuous assessment of the individual’s impact towards the environment, society and economy. One must always keep in mind the consequences of their actions externally.</li>
    <li><span>Thinking Beyond</span> Rather than just looking at the external impacts of their actions in the short-term, evaluation must be done even until the future. Sustainability is all about creating an environment that could provide for everyone, even in the long-term.</li>
  </ul></div>

  <h1>Why Sustainability?</h1>
  <div class="left"><ul>
    <li>Sustainability ensures that <b>decisions and processes made in the present would not comprises the needs of both the present and future generations</b>.</li>
    <li>It looks into flourishing not just the economic development, but take into account the <b>social and environmental aspects</b> as well.</li>
    <li>In other words, sustainability integrates the three dimensions in making a community that is <b>growing in numbers</b>, and <b>sustains the welfare</b> of both the people and planet.</li>
  </ul></div>
</div>

<div id="second">
  <h2>What is Corporate Sustainability?</h2>
  <div class="right"><ul>
    <li>According to the <i>Ivey Business Journal</i>, Corporate Sustainability (CS) is an alternative to the traditional growth and profit maximization model. It recognizes that while <b>corporate growth and profit</b> is important, <b>environmental and societal goals are also important for a corporation’s development</b>.</li>
    <li>According to the <i>UN Global Compact Guide to Corporate Sustainability</i>, CS is a <b>company’s delivery of long-term value</b> in <b>financial</b>, <b>environmental</b>, <b>social</b>, and <b>ethical</b> terms.</li>
  </ul></div>

  <h1>5 pillars of cs</h1>
  <div class="left"><ul>
    <li><span>Principled business</span> Incorporating values and principles into their system and practices. This way, the company’s fundamental responsibilities are met in fields such as human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption.</li>
    <li><span>Strengthening society</span> To empower and become one with society, by helping solve its biggest issues and enrich it in the process.</li>
    <li><span>Leadership commitment</span> To understand and protect the organization's interests and sustainable mindset in both the present and future, whilst taking part in answering the world's biggest problems. </li>
    <li><span>Reporting progress</span> Being transparent with investors and customers regarding an organization’s progress, and creating a discourse with society as a whole. Through this, a company is able to pinpoint problems and how to address them.</li>
    <li><span>Local action</span> Each country has their own issues that need to be addressed. Business have the capability to address and respond to these issues.</li>
  </ul></div>
</div>

<div id="first">

<h2>corporate social responsibility</h2>
<div class="right"><ul>
  <li>Defined as the role of businesses to <b>address social and environmental concerns</b> through their <b>operations and interactions with stakeholders</b></li>
  <li>While it follows the Triple Bottom Line Framework (People, Planet, Profit), it mainly <b>focuses on the firm’s stakeholder interests</b>.</li>
</ul></div>

<h1>CS vs. csr: what's the difference?</h1>
<div class="left"><ul>
  <li><b>Responsibility does not equate to sustainability.</b></li>
  <li><span>CSR</span> projects usually focus on giving out solutions that <b>quickly amend an issue</b> (based on an ethical and moral standpoint), but can <b>disregard underlying issues</b>. These short-term successes can equate to <b>long-term liabilities</b>, compromising the ability to meet future needs.</li>
  <li><span>CSR</span> focuses on solutions that confront immediate problems towards the society; <span>Corporate sustainability</span> looks at the long-term effects of the business’s actions in order to further integrate these into the framework--effectively producing a sustainable company.</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>

<div id="second">
<h3>Sustainability Frameworks</h3>

<h2>Circular Economy</h2>
<div class="right">
  <ul>
    <li>Circular Economy is an economic system of <b>resource management</b> that focuses on a <b>cycle of reducing, reusing, and recycling</b>. This system aims to reduce the resources used in creating everyday products by reducing and reusing raw materials from old products.</li>
    <li>Compared to the <i>make, use, and dispose system</i> of a <span>Linear Economy</span>, a <span>Circular Economy</span> aims to <b>provide longevity for everyday products by promoting <b>sustainable long-term use</b>. This system highlights the use of biodegradable materials and the proper management of our finite resources.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h1>Creating shared value</h1>
<div class="left">
  <ul>
    <li>The concept of creating shared value (CSV) goes beyond the parameters of a company’s own existence, competence, and competitiveness.</li>
    <li>Creating shared value means <b>extending a company’s efforts to the development of the economic and social conditions</b> of its stakeholders and communities that surround it.</li>
    <li><span>Environmental</span> pertains to the manner by which a company acts as a developer and caretaker of nature and the environment rather than causing harm against it.</li>
    <li><span>Social</span> extends to all of a company’s stakeholders including customers, employees, suppliers, and different communities involved; to ensure positive feedback within these relations.</li>
    <li><span>Governance</span> points at a company’s leadership, internal control, and how it functions to meet or satisfy standards and obligations.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Sustainable value matrix</h2>
<div class="leftimg"><img src="./assets/SVM.png" /></div>
<div class="right">
  <ul>
    <li>Sustainable Value Matrix examines the <b>relationship between the societal challenges of global sustainability and the creation of shareholder value</b>.</li>
    <li>The goal of the framework is to be able to <b>create “sustainable value” by identifying strategies and practices</b> that could contribute to a more sustainable world while simultaneously driving shareholder value.</li>
    <li>The four quadrants of the matrix include:
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px; width: 85%;"><li><span>Population Prevention</span> Minimizing waste and emissions from current facilities and operations</li>
      <li><span>Product Stewardship</span> Mngaging stakeholders and managing the full life cycle of today’s products</li>
      <li><span>Clean Technology</span> Developing and deploying “next-generation” clean technologies</li>
      <li><span>Base of the Pyramid</span> Co-creating new businesses to serve the unmet needs of the poor and underserved</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li style="clear: both;">The Sustainable Value Matrix is divided by the two axes: <b>internal to external</b>, and <b>today to tomorrow</b>. Companies can start focusing on internal aspects and how to manage their business today, then slowly build up to working on external aspects and tomorrow's opportunities.</li>
    <li>The positive impact of the four quadrants are as follows:
      <ul style="width: 85%;"><li>Reduce cost and risk (<i>pollution prevention</i>)</li>
      <li>Enhance reputation and legitimacy (<i>product stewardship</i>)</li>
      <li>Accelerate innovation and repositioning (<i>clean technology</i>)</li>
      <li>Crystallize growth path and trajectory (<i>base of the pyramid</i>)</li></ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

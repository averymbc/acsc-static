    <h3>Grade 12 (Humanities & Social Sciences)<br>
      St. Paul College Pasig</h3>
    <p>ACSC was something I would have never even thought of joining due to it being related to business and corporate stuff. <b>I had no idea what corporate sustainability was, all I knew was that I liked the word “sustainability.”</b> Being a HUMSS student, I had no idea what corporate sustainability would be since I was locked in my own personal bubble. However, ACSC opened my mind when it came to how business and people, planet, and profit came hand-in-hand with one another. I was able to <i>learn about the social aspects of business</i> and how it was very close to the reasons why I chose my track. The talks were very informative and <i>allowed me to connect the topics to what I already knew</i>. At the same time, the activities of the conference allowed me to <i>meet new people with similar interests</i>, as well as work with hardworking and talented students from all over the metro with the same interest in sustainability. <b>ACSC helped me want to look beyond what I already knew and see the importance that business also has towards society.</b> ACSC helped me see beyond what companies are thought to be doing and see what they are trying to do to give back towards society. Aside from this, ACSC helped me realize that each individual	can see and practice the importance of corporate sustainability by being educated consumers. Beyond the technicalities I learned, I was able to <i>make memories with the people I met, as well as the stories I learned of the people around me in the span of just two days</i>.</p>

    <h3>BS Management Engineering<br>
      Ateneo de Manila University</h3>
    <p>To be completely honest, <i>I attended ACSC 2017 not expecting much for it.</i> The ACSC applications happened just a few months before the applications for that year’s college entrance tests and for me, this event was nothing more than an opportunity to get a glimpse of the culture in Ateneo and MEA. Little did I know that <b>this experience would drastically change the way I perceive business</b>. The event made me realise that rather than being just a medium to make money, business is an opportunity to <i>make a positive impact</i> on our society and environment. The thing I believe sets ACSC apart is how intentional every part of it is. From the talks to the activities, <b>every single part of the experience was well-thought-of and serves a purpose</b>. They are simple enough that I, who knew nothing about corporate sustainability, was able to understand, but also thorough enough that the whole ACSC experience was still able to leave a lasting impact on me and my fellow participants. All these things plus the wonderful people I met are what made my ACSC experience memorable enough for me to <i>apply again the following year for ACSC 2018, and this year as a Programs core member</i>!</p>

    <h3>Grade 12 (Accountancy, Business, and Management)<br>
      Ateneo de Manila SHS</h3>
    <p>I feel like way too many people live their lives not knowing what sustainability really is. For the longest time, <b>the concept of sustainability was alien to me</b>; it felt abstract and overly-complicated to the point where its importance never previously took center stage in my head. I can quite confidently say that <b>joining ACSC really helped unravel all those misconceptions about sustainability</b> and sustainable practices- both in and out of the business world. In a world where everyone and everything is intertwined with one another, where we constantly have to be reminded of our own responsibility and our own duty to the rest of the community, ACSC was an event that quite clearly helped make sense of it all. <b>It's an experience you won't regret, I promise you.</b></p>

    <h3>Grade 12 (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)<br>

    <p>Joining ACSC, <b>I had doubts and fears that I may not be able to relate as much</b> since <i>I didn’t know a lot about corporate sustainability</i>. Though, that mindset changed when I was finally there during the actual conference. Luckily to be given an opportunity to join this, I can say that it has surely made me grow into <b>a person who values both business and sustainable development</b>; it gave me so much knowledge about things that I have never encountered before. Aside from gaining new experience and knowledge, I also <i>gained new friends</i> whom I still treasure close to me up to now. Definitely, my ACSC experience really made me <i>branch out to new things and to new people</i>, while <b>helping save the world</b> as well.</p>

    <h2>Lyra Gamban</h2>
    <h3>BS Chemical Engineering<br>
      University of the Philippines Diliman</h3>
    <p>Throughout my life, I’ve been interested in how business works and whether negative stigmas and misconceptions of it are true. Is it really only centered on making money, with no concern whatsoever for the environment and the people a business is supposed to cater to? <b>I had several other burning questions in my mind and I’m thankful to believe that I walked out of ACSC with these answered</b>. The thing that was interesting about this experience is that I learned about what it means to be sustainable in the corporate world, not only through the <i>insightful talks</i> held by representatives of a few companies, but also through several <i>interesting hands-on activities</i> I completed with a group of <i>brilliant, curious, and talented individuals</i> whom I was happy to share ideas and strengthen bonds with. Overall, ACSC opened my eyes to the limitless possibilities of a business that considers the People, Planet, and Profit, helped hone my creative thinking, problem solving, and communication skills; and inspired me to be more mindful about the social and environmental impacts of my everyday choices. <b>In short, it taught me to care more about the world I live in.</b></p>
